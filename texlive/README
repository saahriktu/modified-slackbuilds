TeXLive (TeXLive binaries, support files, TeX formats)

This package contains binaries and many support files, TeX formats and
packages, and other files included in the TeXLive TeX distribution.
This should be adequate for the needs of most TeX users.

The remaining stuff can be found in texlive-extra and texlive-docs,
all of which are also available at SlackBuilds.org.

Have a look at the scripts in the prep/ directory to see how the texmf
archives were created from the original Texlive netarchives.

Note that this package conflicts with the tetex packages in Slackware,
so you'll need to remove tetex and tetex-doc before installing TeXLive.
